# web-tour: the port
##About  
>_the port_ is a travel app I designed for The Iron Yard for a class project.  
This app was designed for those vacationing in Antarctica. The port was designed with a Mobile first strategy and was later developed for the web. 

##Under The Hood
> Under the hood we are using the ever popular _bootstrap_ framework. 
The port is also featuring exculsive hover techniques with a self-programmed scrolling affect.
The logo was designed through feelogo.com and the color scheme was influenced by the genuine blue most of the arctic atmosphere emits.


##Struggles
>My greatest struggle was adjusting the app to wider screen sizes. I accomplished this through bootstrp media queries. Although tedius, I feel the mobile scale is represented accuratley on a wider screen size.   

###Please Note
This project was for design pruposes only and thus there is no functional/procedural processes coded as of yet.
